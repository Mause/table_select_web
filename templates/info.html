                Attendee's of the Margaret River Senior High School Ball o' 2013 select a table from the <a href="/">homepage</a>, enter their name and the name of their partner, and it is stored in the system.

                If an attendee makes a choice which they later wish to change, they simply click the small x next to the entry they wish to change.
                Due to a risk of abuse, the change is not made immediately.
                The change must be approved by moderators.
